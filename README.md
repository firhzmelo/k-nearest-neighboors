# K-Nearest-Neighbors

In this project i implemented the K-Nearest-Neighbors Classifier (KNN), this was much more simple than the [Linear Regression](https://github.com/firhzmelo/linear-regression), but i could practice numpy and list comprehension although i need more practice on that. I enjoyed the project and i found it facinating how such a simple algorithm could be very useful (the downside it is a ittle slow with a lot of data).
